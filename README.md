# Smart Biometric Door Lock System

## Project Description
This project, "Smart Biometric Door Lock," integrates hardware and software components to create a secure and smart locking system. It uses a fingerprint sensor for authentication, controlling a solenoid door lock through an ESP32 microcontroller. The system also features an OLED module for display and is integrated with the Cayenne IoT cloud platform for remote monitoring and control.

## Hardware Components
- **Fingerprint Sensor**: For biometric authentication.
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Acts as the central processing unit for controlling other components.
- **OLED Module**: For displaying system statuses and messages.
- **Solenoid Door Lock**: The actual locking mechanism controlled by the system.
- **Relay Module**: To safely interface the solenoid lock with the ESP32.

## Software and Libraries
- **C++ Programming Language**: Used for programming the ESP32.
- **Arduino IDE**: For writing, compiling, and uploading the code to the ESP32.
- **Cayenne IoT Cloud Platform**: For remote access and control, and for adding new users to the system.
- **Libraries**: Adafruit_Fingerprint, U8g2lib, WiFi, CayenneMQTTESP32, etc.

## Features
- **Fingerprint-Based Unlocking**: Secure access control using biometric authentication.
- **Remote User Management**: Ability to add new users remotely via Cayenne.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: OLED display provides real-time status of the system.
- **Cloud Integration**: Cayenne IoT platform integration for remote monitoring.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Hardware Assembly**: Connect the fingerprint sensor, OLED module, relay module, and solenoid door lock to the ESP32 according to the schematic provided.
2. **Software Setup**: Install Arduino IDE and required libraries (`Adafruit_Fingerprint`, `U8g2lib`, `WiFi`, `CayenneMQTTESP32`).
3. **Programming**: Open the provided code in Arduino IDE, modify the WiFi credentials and Cayenne authentication info as necessary, and upload it to the ESP32.
4. **Cayenne Setup**: Create an account on the Cayenne IoT cloud platform and set up the device dashboard for remote monitoring and control.

## Usage
- **Enrollment**: New fingerprints can be added through the Cayenne dashboard.
- **Operation**: The system authenticates fingerprints placed on the sensor and unlocks the door if the fingerprint is recognized.
- **Monitoring**: Check the status and manage the system remotely via the Cayenne dashboard.
